MIPS CPU Simulator
==================

This is a MIPS processor prototype written in C language.

It Simulates MIPS processor running states: instruction fetch, decode, execute, pc update, exception handler.

It also provides basic debug functions for MIPS ASM programs: next, step, breakpoint, run, memory/register watch and PC jump.

My project: https://github.com/hdl/mips is written in VHDL based on this prototype.
